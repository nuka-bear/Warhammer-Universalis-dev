 flavor_blazing_sun.2.t:0 "Formation of the Grand Order of the Blazing Sun"
 flavor_blazing_sun.2.d:0 "With our successive achievements of our conquest, the administration of our realm is getting more and more exhausting for the order.

But for our goals we have to reform our limiting rules of the order."
 flavor_blazing_sun.2.a:0 "Let us reform into the Grand Order of the Blazing Sun!"
