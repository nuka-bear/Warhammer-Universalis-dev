 flavor_athel_loren.2.t:0 "The Awakening of Orion"
 flavor_athel_loren.2.d:0 "As the first light of dawn pierces through the ancient canopies of Athel Loren, a hushed reverence falls over the woodland realms. The air shimmers with a vibrant energy, a whisper of forgotten tales long buried beneath the roots of the great trees. In a sacred glade, surrounded by the ancient spirits of the forest, the essence of nature itself begins to coalesce.\n\nSuddenly, the ground trembles as a surge of primal magic bursts forth. A radiant figure emerges from the foliage, crowned with antlers adorned with blooming flora, embodying the wild and untamed spirit of the Hunt. Orion, the eternal king of the Wood Elves, has returned to lead his people once more.\n\nWith a voice that echoes like the rustle of leaves, he calls forth the creatures of the forest, rallying them to his side. The Wood Elves, filled with a renewed sense of purpose, prepare to defend their sacred lands against all encroaching threats. The balance of nature is restored, and the legend of Orion lives on, a reminder of the forest's indomitable will."
