 bookmark_karl_franz_desc: "This is a dark age, a bloody age, an age of daemons and of sorcery. It is an age of battle and death, and of the world's ending. Amidst all of the fire, flame and fury it is a time, too, of mighty heroes, of bold deeds and great courage. \n\nChoose a nation and lead it to victory or perish in the ashes."
