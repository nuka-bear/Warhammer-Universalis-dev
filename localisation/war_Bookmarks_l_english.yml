 bookmark_karl_franz_desc: "This is a dark age, a bloody age, an age of daemons and of sorcery. It is an age of battle and death, and of the world's ending. Amidst all of the fire, flame and fury it is a time, too, of mighty heroes, of bold deeds and great courage. \n\nChoose a nation and lead it to victory or perish in the ashes."

 bookmark_southlands_desc: " In the Badlands, Orcs struggle with each other, the dwarves, and their own baser insticts to raise the WAAAGH and raize the world. In the Nehekharan Deserts, Undead Tomb Kings vie for legitimacy in reclaiming the greatest empire. On the the coast, the Araby nations vacillate between rival influences advising peace and war. \n\nChoose a nation and lead it to victory or perish in the ashes."

 bookmark_far_east_desc: "In the Darklands, the militant Chaos Dwarves clash with orcs and ogres for control of this desolate region. In the Mountains of Mourn, Ogres extract coin from caravans and the earth. In the distant East, Grand Cathay balances on a knife's edge - this greatest of all kingdoms is fractured by warlords and local power brokers, but still ostensibly a single nation. \n\nChoose a nation and lead it to victory or perish in the ashes."
