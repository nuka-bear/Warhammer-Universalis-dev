 ##### Nehekharan Culture


### Access to the Sea
gen_nekekhara_missions_1_title:0 "Command the Endless Seas"
gen_nekekhara_missions_1_desc:0 "For centuries, our power was confined to the desert. But Nehekhara was once a seafaring empire, dominating the trade routes from the western coasts to the furthest reaches of the east. By rebuilding our ancient fleets and reclaiming the coastal cities, we shall extend our influence beyond the sands and remind the world of the indomitable will of the Tomb Kings."

### Build Capital

### Rebuild Monument

gen_nekekhara_missions_3_desc:0 "The statues and monuments that dot our lands are the legacy of the greatest pharaohs, whose deeds and glories are written in the stone itself. These structures, now fallen into ruin, must be restored to their former glory so that all who gaze upon them will remember that Nehekhara is a land of gods and kings. We must bring life back to these monuments of eternity."

### Retake Symbols of Power

The Valley of Kings, the Tomb of Settra the Imperishable, and the Great Sphinx of Numasis must be returned to us. These symbols of power are a reminder that Nehekhara was, and always shall be, the realm of undying kings. We will take back what is rightfully ours and restore our dominion over the land of the dead."

### Reclaim Nehekhara
gen_nekekhara_missions_5_title:0 "The Eternal Dominion"
gen_nekekhara_missions_5_desc:0 "The time has come to reassert our ancient claim over the lands of Nehekhara. The other kingdoms have faded to dust, and we alone remain to carry forward the legacy of the gods. We shall ride forth with an army of the undying and drive out any who dare to oppose us. Our dominion shall extend from the desert sands to the farthest reaches of the world, for we are the rightful heirs of Nehekhara."

### Please the Mortuary Cults

gen_nehekharan_pantheon_missions_1_desc:0 "The Mortuary Cults, keepers of sacred knowledge and guardians of the afterlife, hold the keys to ancient magic that binds us to this realm.

They will release legions of the undying from their tombs, an army to march under our eternal banner."

### Construct Temples

By honoring our gods, we fortify our realm with divine favor and invite their wrath upon those who defy us."

gen_nehekharan_expand_religion_desc:0 "The ancient gods of Nehekhara – Ptra, Usirian, Djaf, and Asaph – have blessed our return. But their influence has waned beyond the borders of our empire, as foreign lands have turned to false idols. We shall rekindle the ancient flames of faith, bringing the glory of Nehekhara’s pantheon to these lands. As the true gods take root once more, they shall grant us their divine favor, securing our realm with eternal stability and strength."

We must be prepared to pay it, for we shall emerge as rulers of life and death alike."
