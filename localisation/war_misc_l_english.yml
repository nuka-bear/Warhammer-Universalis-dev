 desc_destruction_nation:0 "Evil is one of alignments a nation can be. Those nations who follow the teachings of Evil emphasize the ideals of war, chaos, death and destruction as major elements in their beliefs and social structure.\n\nAn Evil civilization will not automatically engage in war with a neighboring civilization of a differing alignment--instead, it receives a slight penalty to diplomatic relations with all Neutral-aligned civilizations, and a massive penalty to diplomatic relations with all Good-aligned nations. These penalties do not force war, but influence the relationships between nations: it is more difficult to form lasting trade relations, open borders, and long-term peace with nations that are aligned differently, but relatively easy to keep nations with similar alignments happy."
