Assembled within the sacred halls of the Grail Cathedral, as many Grail Knights as can attend gather to fulfill their solemn duty in selecting the next ruler of Bretonnia. \n\n Amidst the hallowed whispers of ancient rites and the solemn prayers to the Lady of the Lake, the Grail Knights deliberate with unwavering resolve. Each voice carries the weight of tradition and honor as they seek to discern the candidate most worthy of wielding the mantle of kingship. \n\n Once a unanimous decision is reached, the chosen successor is presented to the Fay Enchantress, the holy representative of the Lady of the Lake.

Amidst cheers and applause from the assembled nobility, the unity of the realm is reaffirmed, and the kingdom stands united under the banner of its new Royarch.\n\n Let the trumpets sound and the banners wave high, for a new chapter in the history of Bretonnia has begun.

 flavor_bretonnia.9.d:0 "With the fall of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] the last remnants of the Kingdom of Bretonnia have been crushed.

With a solemn voice, they declare their intention to embark on the Grail Quest, a sacred pilgrimage in search of the legendary Grail that has long been the symbol of Bretonnian honor and chivalry.\n\nAs a ruler of Bretonnia, you are faced with a momentous decision. Will you grant [Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName] your blessing and support in their noble quest, knowing that they may face dangers and trials beyond imagination? Or will you counsel caution, urging them to remain by your side and fulfill their duties to the realm?\n\nChoose wisely, for the fate of your heir and the future of Bretonnia hang in the balance. Should you grant your blessing, your heir will set forth on a journey of epic proportions, seeking to prove themselves worthy of the Grail and the divine favor of the Lady of the Lake. But be warned - the road ahead is fraught with peril, and not all who embark on the Grail Quest return unchanged.\n\nConsider your decision carefully, for the choices you make now will shape the destiny of [Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName] and the kingdom of Bretonnia for generations to come. Will they emerge victorious, bathed in the light of the Lady's grace? Or will they be lost to the mists of legend, their fate forever intertwined with the mysteries of the Grail?"

 flavor_bretonnia.210.t:0 "Questions of Warfare"
 flavor_bretonnia.210.desc:0 "War is a costly matter. It takes resources, men and effort, and victory is not always assured. In the face of growing threats and the advancements of our rivals, the king has proposed the Gunpowder Edict. This bold move could modernize our military, but it risks alienating our traditional knights and nobility. What path shall we take?"

 flavor_bretonnia.220.desc:0 "The Fey, with their ethereal beauty and capricious nature, have long been a part of Bretonnian lore.

 flavor_bretonnia.250.t:0 "Religious Debate within Bretonnia"
 flavor_bretonnia.250.desc:0 "Religion plays a vital role in our society, woven into the very fabric of our noble traditions. However, the spiritual authority has waned, and the ruling family has increasingly become the focal point of public attention in fair Bretonnia\n\nThe Clergy seeks to restore the reverence for the Lady of the Lake and elevate the role of faith in our kingdom. They are currently engaged in discussions with our esteemed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the various estates, striving to weave religion back into the heart of our nation and reaffirm its significance in the lives of our people."
 flavor_bretonnia.250.a:0 "The clergy is right. We should put more emphasize on religion."
 flavor_bretonnia.250.b:0 "Religion is part of our state, yes. But it is underneath the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 flavor_bretonnia.250.c:0 "We should treat religion more as a tool for our gains than as a tradition."

 flavor_bretonnia.200.t:0 "Charting the Course Ahead"
 flavor_bretonnia.200.desc:0 "Our noble King has valiantly defended our lands, ensuring a brighter future for Bretonnia. Yet, it is evident that we now lack a clear direction. As the dawn of a new era approaches, the time has come to choose the path that will guide our kingdom and uphold the ideals of chivalry and honor."

 flavor_bretonnia.230.desc:0 "Our [Root.GovernmentName] is making strides in crafting a government that serves the needs of both the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the noble people of [Root.GetName]. Yet, not all share our vision of progress. The great estates of our realm have gathered in the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName], voicing their discontent and threatening our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a coup should we fail to grant them the privileges they seek in this new order."
 flavor_bretonnia.230.a:0 "Grant Them Useless Rights"
 flavor_bretonnia.230.b:0 "Assure Them of Their Privileges"
 flavor_bretonnia.230.c:0 "Execute Them for Treason"

 flavor_bretonnia.240.t:0 "Little Economic Golden Age"
 flavor_bretonnia.240.desc:0 "Our economy is experiencing a brief golden age. Despite our generous expenditures, we find ourselves with a positive revenue. Our advisors counsel that we use these savings to invest in one of the key aspects of our realm's future."
 flavor_bretonnia.240.a:0 "Enhance Infrastructure"
 flavor_bretonnia.240.b:0 "Support the Arts and Culture"
 flavor_bretonnia.240.c:0 "Invest in Military Strength"

 flavor_bretonnia.260.t:0 "The Role of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 flavor_bretonnia.260.desc:0 "The title of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] carries great prestige, embodying the ideals of chivalry and noble duty. In many other realms governed by [Root.GovernmentName], the role of this title is clear: ruler of the state. Yet, our [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has the potential to be so much more. Throughout our storied history, there have been many noble kings who personally administered the realm, navigated delicate diplomacy with foreign powers, and led their gallant knights to victory on the battlefield. The question remains: what path shall our esteemed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] choose in these changing times"
 flavor_bretonnia.260.a:0 "The treasury and administration require a steady hand—like mine."
 flavor_bretonnia.260.b:0 "Diplomacy is a delicate art, one that I must personally oversee"
 flavor_bretonnia.260.c:0 "Nothing rivals the glory of battle. I will take to the field myself"
