### Starting Events

cathay_events.0.t:0 "An Empire of Fractured Dominions"
cathay_events.0.d:0 "The Celestial Empire may span the vast lands of Cathay, but it is a patchwork of semi-autonomous dominions and territories ruled by distant lords and ambitious magistrates. While all swear fealty to the Dragon Throne, loyalty is often tenuous and enforced more by tradition than unity. Many of these provinces quietly chafe under the mandate, dreaming of independence or even challenging the Emperor’s authority.\n\nTo secure our rule, we must keep a watchful eye on these restless dominions and suppress the seeds of rebellion before they grow too bold.\n\n§RBuild trust and favors with domains, eventually converting them into more easily controlled vassals with the -Vassalize Dominion- influence action. Rebellious domains may attempt to make you a domain. They they succeed, then all of your dominions go to your new overlord.§"
cathay_events.0.a:0 "Cathay Will Endure!"



cathay_events.1.t:0 "Vamprism in Cathay"
cathay_events.1.d:0 "The Jianshi Court is recognized by the Dragon Empire, but our vampiric nature has been a cause of unease and suspicion among the living lords of Cathay. The mortal realms around us refuse to see the rightful place of the undead as masters over the living. Through careful diplomacy, conquest, and subtle influence, we shall one day take our rightful place as rulers of Cathay.\n\nFor now, we are tolerated only by the strict adherence to Cathayan protocol, yet this acceptance is brittle and temporary. We must forge alliances and turn mortal minds to our cause before this tolerance shatters.\n\n§RUse the -Convert Them- influence action or the -Implant Cults- spy action to spread vampirism throughout Cathay.§"
