 bretonnian_dukedom_subject_long_desc:0 "A Bretonnian Dukedom Vassal behaves similarly to a normal vassal and joins its overlord's wars, has a slightly reduced base liberty desire, is not restricted in its diplomacy and doesn't cost a diplomatic relation. It can only be established by §BBretonnian§! countries in the §RBretonnian§! region with §BBretonnian§! countries in the §RBretonnian§! region. Only one country can have Bretonnian Dukedoms at the same time and they can only have §Y13§! at most. Until Bretonnia is formed when the current overlord dies, all Bretonnian Dukedoms elect the next overlord and only potential overlords that have a ruler with a grail knight personality trait are eligable. If a country other than the current overlord wins, all Bretonnian Dukedoms are transfered to that country and the current overlord becomes a Bretonnian Dukedoms themself."
