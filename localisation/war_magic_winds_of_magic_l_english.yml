 warhammer_setup.5.d:0 "Magic is a wind, which flows from great Chaos Rifts on from the poles. It flows out as dark and chaotic Dhar wind, but later splits into eight winds, each of which governs a certain aspect. The greatest wizards in the world can then weave the winds back into a single force - Qhaysh, or High Magic. The winds are fickle and their flow may wax and wane multiple times during the same battle. The winds are unpredictable and hard to control, so wizards trying to harness too much power at once tend to invite unpleasant surprises; the rampant energy can burst outward, incinerating allies, scar the mind and soul of the wizard (robbing him of magical power), or just obliterate the wizard outright. Magic is a powerful and dangerous force"
