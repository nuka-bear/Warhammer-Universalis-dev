This has caused widespread fear and outrage among the leaders of the Revolution, who fear yet another purge of their ranks. Already the National Assembly is moving to demand his arrest and curb the worst excesses of his Reign of Terror, returning stability to the realm and ensuring that no one may use the chaos as an excuse to restore the monarchy.\n\nHowever, it seems that Robespierre still has many supporters who will surely seek to protect him if we do not move swiftly."
