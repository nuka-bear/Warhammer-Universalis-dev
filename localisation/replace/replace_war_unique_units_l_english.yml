Rich saurmurai are known to wear highly decorated and expensive armor, with the clan mon proudly displayed, often wearing headdresses with horns and spikes to intimidate their foes.\nSaurmurai can be recruited in owned provinces that belong to the §YDragon Isle Lizardmen§! culture, and the number of Saurmurai that can be raised is dependent on the development of those provinces."
