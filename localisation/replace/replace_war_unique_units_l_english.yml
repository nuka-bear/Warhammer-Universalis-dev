Rich saurmurai are known to wear highly decorated and expensive armor, with the clan mon proudly displayed, often wearing headdresses with horns and spikes to intimidate their foes.\nSaurmurai can be recruited in owned provinces that belong to the §YDragon Isle Lizardmen§! culture, and the number of Saurmurai that can be raised is dependent on the development of those provinces."

Grail Knights are considered living saints and even demigods by their fellow Bretonnians, infused with the divine power of their kingdom's patron goddess, the Lady of the Lake. Capable of feats far beyond those of normal cavalry but often requiring vastly greater upkeep, they are few in number but legendary in their impact on a battle.\n\nThe number of §YGrail Knights§! regiments is calculated based on the development of provinces with accepted cultures at a rate of 1 unit per 100 development."
