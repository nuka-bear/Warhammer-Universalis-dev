 desc_feudalism:0 "Over time, most societies develop a need for a common structure with stronger and more permanent institutions of government. With the establishment of the Empire and Bretonnia this need came to be filled by a number of institutions and customs that taken together are often considered to be part of the Human 'Feudal' system. For similar reasons, permanent government and societal systems have formed all over the world, some of which have roots that go far further back than Feudalism itself.\nUnlike the other Institutions, 'Feudalism' covers a wide range of different systems and exists from the start in all parts of the world where a strong tradition of Urbanism, Institutionalized Government and Social Stratification has reached a critical point. The institution can spread from contact with any of these cultures, or in some cases begin to grow on its own in a society that fulfills certain criteria."
 desc_renaissance:0 "Since the 25th century IC, the wealthy and powerful of the Old World have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Reman, Dwarven and Elven Empires. As a cultural movement the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Enlightened scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the Classical philosophers. Renaissance Humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early Printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Renaissance scholar is an expert on everything from politics and philosophy to art, textual analysis, music and architecture. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit its classical ideals."
 desc_new_world_i:0 "While Marco Colombo 'discovered' the new world in 1492 IC, recent technological advances within the Old World have ushered in a new age of discovery. As the promises of priceless loot tempts many Old Worlders across the ocean, a new age has been ushered not only for the colonizers and the colonized, it has also led to the spread of materials and techniques as well as a realization of the vastness of the globe. As animals, crop types, silver and diseases spread across the great ocean, the first steps have been taken towards a truly global economy. With foreign lands and people being mapped and documented, ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate are increasingly being colored by what we have found in overseas societies. Great minds feel the need to question what was once truth, and from Altdorf to the City of Spices, the nature of the world is now up for debate."
 desc_printing_press:1 "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information and in many ways early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by Renaissance men such as the Imperial Printer Gunthur Johans, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available.\n\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout the Old World, hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from Religious and Political pamphlets to scientific treatises and instructions on how to behave are circulating the continent. With print shops growing evermore commonplace, rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique as the comparatively easy means of production means censorship can be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."
 desc_global_trade:0 "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes by the High Elves of Ulthuan. All trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the spread of High Elven charts, sea routes around the Southlands and the crossing of the Jade Sea by Humans, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\n\nIron mined and wrought in the Karaz-Ankor is being sold in the Southlands by Tilean merchants, and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the Far East trade sphere. Local Ind merchants are investing in future Old Worlder trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly Global Economy but surely the first seeds have been sown."
 desc_manufactories:0 "While a number of technical innovations during the course of the 26th and 27th centuries have increased the output of production for some products such as iron or cloth to an extent, the biggest improvement in the field of production has come in the form of new forms of organization. By creating manufactories, often outside the city limits, merchant capitalists can both bypass the ancient guild laws that inhibit mass production as well as pioneer ways to increase production through the organization and specialization of labor in one place. The forerunners of the later Industrialization are able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor rather than by expensive new machinery. This is in itself a huge change over the often heavily regulated methods of old, however, and together with later technical advances this new mode of production will come to revolutionize society."
 desc_enlightenment:0 "The last century has seen Rationalism and Empiricism gaining an ever-increasing popularity among the great minds of the age. In letters, publications and coffee houses, kings, scientists, philosophers and littérateurs are discussing the merits of tolerance, the scientific method and the spreading of the ideals of the Enlightenment to all of humanity. From universities or courts of enlightened monarchs, expeditions are being sent to measure, catalogue, weigh and map the world so that we can better understand the laws that govern the things around us. Others discuss the laws that govern society and try to reach an understanding of the Rights of Man.\n\nGreat projects such as the colossal undertaking of creating a complete encyclopedia of all knowledge or a complete index of all plants, animals and fungi in the world are being pursued for the greater good of humanity. The Light of Reason has been lit and many will not rest until it has been brought to all corners of the earth."
