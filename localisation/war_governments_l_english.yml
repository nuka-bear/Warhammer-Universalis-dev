We have to—no one else in the Empire cares a fig about us."\n\n—Chancellor Wolfram Hertwig\n\nThe League of Ostermark is a major and late-founding Imperial province that lies at the most north-eastern corners of the Empire of Man. Though having existed during the founding of the Empire, the League itself was formed out of the chaos of the late 19th century, when their former capital of Mordheim was struck by a comet of tremendous size. The resulting destruction of the province's central goverment and the death of the ruling family led the remaining towns and villages of the lands to band together and form a new semi-democratic government which would later become known as the League of Ostermark."

Such is the demand for these ferocious creations that Clan Moulder is one of the wealthiest of all Skaven Clans. While many are jealous of Clan Moulder's might, few dare to openly challenge them, not when the clan can field an entire army of grotesquely mutated war-beasts. "

This will-will be great-best invention! Make-force all skaven bow-grovel! Destroy-kill all-all enemies!'\n\nClan Skryre are the inventors and industrialists of the Skaven Under-Empire. From their headquarters in Skavenblight, they create foul machines which combine magic and science to destroy the enemies of the Skaven. Doom-Flayers, Doomwheels, Doomrockets, Warplock Jezzails, Warpfire Throwers, Warp Lightning Cannons and Ratling Guns are all inventions of Clan Skryre, as is the poison gas used by Poison Wind Globadiers. Clan Skryre are also one of the richest and most influential clans - they make a fortune hiring their war machines to other clans, and their leader Lord Morskittar, known as the Emperor of Warlocks, has a seat on the Council of Thirteen. Ikit Claw himself is not the overall clan leader, but an important high-ranking Warlock Engineer. The inventions of Clan Skryre rival and in some cases surpass those of the Engineers of the Dwarfs and Chaos Dwarfs. "

To the Lords of Decay, the assassins are valuable tools that should not be squandered like hapless Clanrats.'\n—Skreelin Thurntik, Grey Seer.\n\nClan Eshin is one of the Four Great Skaven Clans which specialises in the deadly and secretive arts of stealth, murder, poison and assassination learned from the exotic Far East. Of all the clans which populates the Under-Empire, Clan Eshin is by far the most secretive and hidden. This mysterious Clan has eyes and ears everywhere and its deadly operatives are scattered throughout the Under-Empire as well as secreted about within the cities and settlements of the surface dwellers. For the right price, the black-clad agents of Clan Eshin will steal any information, commit any act of ruthless sabotage or assassinate any rival with ruthless efficiency."

Bring Skrolk to the Wormstone, and you will be Plague Priest. Betray, and you become pus-bag.'\n\nClan Pestilens is one of the four Greater Clans. Its members are the Plague Monks – the disciples of disease and decay. Clan Pestilens dedicate themselves with insane fervour to spreading corruption in the name of the Great Horned Rat. Pestilens was the first clan to reach Lustria; there, in the hot, fetid conditions, did the disease-ridden ratmen start to overcome the climate to found Clan Pestilens. It wasn’t long before the emergent clan encountered the Lizardmen and an age-old enmity was born. Of all the warm-blooded invaders to trespass on Lustria, it is the Skaven – and Clan Pestilens in particular – that the Lizardmen hate the most. Eventually, after decades of self-imposed exile, the Plague Monks re-joined the Under-Empire and immediately claimed their place on the Council of Thirteen."
