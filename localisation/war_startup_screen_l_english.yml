 string_start_naggaroth:0 "§g\"There are not enough words in your simple tongue to express our hatred for them, Human. Killers, despoilers, slavers and thieves we name them, but not one of these oft-earned titles begins to describe the depths of their depravity. They have neither mercy nor honour. They roam and kill in darkness called up by their foul sorceries. They are so base as to specifically target children for their depredations. The capricious folk of Ulthuan claim that they are their despised kin, exiled long ago, but truly, can one ever trust the words of an Elf?".\n-Hargrim Furgilsson, Dwarf Trader§!\n\nIn the chill land of Naggaroth lies a realm steeped in malice. This is the home of the Dark Elves, the outcast warrior children of Ulthuan. They watch the world with malevolent eyes, knowing it is their birthright to rule and the destiny of all others to serve, if they are permitted to live at all. Yet the Dark Elves know that they cannot claim their glorious inheritance while the hated betrayers the High Elves endure. They are two halves of a race sundered long ago, separated by the greatest betrayal ever to occur in all the ages of the world, when the soft and weak Asur cast out those who had loyally fought to defend their homeland. Even should every other land bow to their rule, the Naggarothi will not rest until they have brought ruin to the traitors of Ulthuan, toppled their temples, and driven them into the sea.\n\nOn that day the Witch King of Naggaroth, Malekith himself, will finally claim a throne long denied him, and his and his alone rule will spread to every corner of the world."

 #land of the dead
 string_start_title_nehekhara:0 "Nehekhara - the Tomb Kings"
 string_start_nehekhara:0 "The lands of §YNehekhara§! were once vast and fertile and for more than a thousand years it prospered and grew in influence, ruled by Priest Kings, each of whom controlled a city state. Greatest amongst the Priest Kings was §YSettra§!, first to unify Nehekhara under his authority, and it was Settra who brought the Mortuary Cult to power, for he wished to find a way to conquer death itself and rule eternally. Though the Cult could prolong the lives of their rulers greatly, they could not stave off death entirely, and instead promised a future glorious eternal afterlife. This promise led directly to the Nehekharan obsession with death and countless tombs were created to house the Royal families of Nehekhara as generations passed, until the riches of the dead far outweighed those of the living. \n\nNehekhara's fate came in the form of §YNagash§!, a genius Priest turned Necromancer who wrought the Great Ritual that laid waste to the land, slew every living soul, and bound the dead to his will in a state of undeath. Nagash was fortunately defeated and the risen Kings of Nehekhara regained their free will, but found they now ruled over a blasted land of undeath. Yet mummified undead Kings are Kings still, generations of rulers accustomed to unquestioned authority and power, and they now set forth with their numberless undead legions and animated statues to reclaim their lost empire."

 #skaven
 string_start_title_skaven:0 "Rise of the Under-Empire"
 string_start_skaven:0 "The Skaven are a race of malevolent and diabolical race of large, intelligent, humanoid rats that inhabit the underground of the Warhammer world, known as the Under-Empire. The sprawlings tunnels of the Under-Empire reach from the steaming jungles of the South Lands to the snow-covered steppes of Kislev, from the Western borders of Estalia and Bretonnia to the distant realms of the Far East.\n\nAt the very heart of Skavendom lies the horrific underground city of Skavenblight, hidden in the centre of the foul marches lying on the western borders of Tilea. There the  mighty Lords of Decay, ruthless rulers of all Skaven, sit in the Council of Thirteen, scheming and planning in preparation for the time when their armies will emerge from their subterranean realm to raze the entire surface world and rule over its ruins, which they refer to as the Great Ascendancy. This is the ultimate ambition of the Skaven race, a destiny which is preached by the Grey Seers, who are prophets of the Horned Rat - the festering, disgusting god Skaven deity. \n\nSkaven society follows a strict heirarchy; the Council of Thirteen and Grey Seers at the top, the Greater and Warlord Clans in the middle and the countless masses of slaves at the bottom. The fortunes of any individual are a different matter though; no race is so prone to scheming, intrigue and outright betrayal as the Skaven, with each ratlike mind devoted almost entirely to climbing the slippery ladder of power. Every skaven knows it is genius surrounded by expendable fools, and they will eventually rise to command all it surveys and conquer the above-ground in the name of their scabrous deity, for it is the ultimate recipient of the Horned Rat’s favour.\n\n§RSkaven, have a tough time administering lands above ground or outside of cities."

# Greenskin

 string_start_badlands_gs:0 "There is no race so pervasive, prolific, diverse, and destructive as the Greenskins. From cowardly Goblins to rugged Orcs and lumbering Trolls they are a bane to civilisations across the known world.\n\nThe cradle of the greenskins is the Badlands. Where they originally came from no one knows, but where they are strongest now is the Badlands.\n\n Greenskins thrive on war, and dissolve in peace. War is necessary for their economy to function. A warlord who embraces peace will find his coffers empty, his armies disbanded, and his men standing behind him with choppers. \n\nWith such multitudes of greenskins, it is only a matter of time before a great warlord arises from the countless masses, and the time has come. Rally the greenskins of the Badlands, and perhaps the World, for the greatest WAAAGH! yet to come.\n\n§RGreenskins Fightiness may be found on the government tab. Win battles to increase fightiness."

 #dwarf
 string_start_title_dwarf:0 "Age of Retribution"
 string_start_dwarf:0 "§OPrimer§!\nThe Dwarfs are an ancient race, said to have been birthed from solid stone. This seems plausible, for the spirit and body of a Dwarf are hardy like stone. Many centuries ago the Dwarfs enjoyed an era of peace and prosperity known as the Golden Age, with an empire of Karaks connected by countless underground passages, featuring powerful militaries, gold, silver, iron and gromril in unimaginable abundance and rune-endowed halls full of laughter and song.\n\nHowever the Dwarfs found they had many enemies and very few true friends. As first, the arrogant Elves betrayed the Dwarfs, starting a centuries long conflict known as the War of Vengeance. The Dwarfen victory in the conflict was short-lived, as shortly after hordes of Greenskins and foul Skaven swarmed against their defences. In time the Dwarfs, strong as they may have been, were reduced to a shadow of their former glory, eroded much as a mighty mountain is by mere rain and wind.\n\nBut as the other races squabble amongst themselves and forget the wisdom of their fathers, Dwarfs hone their skills and work together to reforge their shattered empire. As the the time of the Age of Retribution draws closer, the power of Dwarf determination grows stronger.\n\n§RDwarves have a tough time administering lands above ground."

string_start_title_arabyn:0 "The Kingdoms of Araby"
string_start_arabyn:0 "In 2502 IC, Araby stands divided between two competing visions for its future. The noble class, wealthy from trade and conquest, pushes for a new Jihad to reclaim past glories. Their eyes turn to Estalia and Tilea, seeing opportunity for expansion and a chance to unite the fractured tribes under a banner of war. For the emirs and sultans, Jihad is not only a religious duty but a way to secure power and ensure their legacy.\n\nIn contrast, Araby's clerics, respected by the common folk, advocate for peace and inward development. They argue that war has weakened the nation and call for a focus on piety, knowledge, and rebuilding the strength of Araby through economic reforms and cultural preservation.\n\n As tension grows between these two forces, the future of Araby hangs in the balance—will it follow the path of war, or seek strength in peace?"

## Cathay
string_start_title_cathay:0 "Cathay - A Kingdom on the Edge of Chaos"
string_start_cathay:0 "Grand Cathay remains a vast and powerful empire, its cities glittering under the rule of the Dragon Emperor and his children. Yet, beneath this grandeur, the unity of Cathay is strained. Each region of the empire is effectively governed by different factions—some led by the Dragon Emperor’s children, others by ambitious warlords, powerful merchant guilds, or secretive sorcerers. While the Emperor’s divine authority remains unchallenged in name, his control over the sprawling empire is increasingly symbolic.\n\nThese regional rulers hold significant autonomy, and in many areas, non-governmental power brokers wield more influence than the Dragon Throne itself. Merchant consortiums control trade routes, religious sects shape local policies, and ancient academies guard arcane secrets that even the imperial court dares not interfere with. The empire remains a formidable force, but its true power lies in the delicate balance between these competing factions, each with its own agenda, all vying for dominance within Cathay’s vast borders.\n\nCan the Imperial Throne reign in these rogue elements? Will a prince claim the throne? Or will the realm fall to chaos?\n\n§RCathay is a network of Dominions, semi-independent subjects that may war upon each other. Force the ruler into a dominion to take all of his dominions for yourself."

## Ogres
string_start_title_ogre:0 "The Ogre Tribes - Feeding off Greater Powers"
string_start_ogre:0 "The Ogre Kingdoms, scattered across the brutal expanse of the Mountains of Mourn, remain a fractured and fearsome presence. Along the Ivory Road, their warbands regularly descend upon caravans, shaking down traders for gold, supplies, and fresh meat. These marauding ogres are united only by their devotion to the Great Maw, a monstrous deity that demands endless sacrifice. Yet, to their great distress, the sacred Great Maw crater lies in the hands of Grand Cathay, a constant source of tension and humiliation for the ogre tribes. \n\nThough fearsome in battle, the ogres remain disorganized, each tribe driven by its own needs for food and plunder. Some whisper of a potential unification—of a time when the warring bands might come together to form a true kingdom, driven by hunger and the desire to reclaim their holy site. Yet, for now, they remain little more than wandering bandits, feared by all who dare traverse their desolate lands. The question looms - will the ogres remain divided, or rise as a cohesive force to challenge the world?"

## Chaos Dwarves

string_start_chaos_dwarf:0 "In the Dark Lands, the Chaos Dwarves of Zharr-Naggrund gather their strength, their forges burning night and day as they prepare for war. Militant and tyrannical, these twisted descendants of the dwarven race are united in their devotion to Hashut, the Father of Darkness, whose fiery will drives their endless expansion. Their obsidian towers rise above slave-filled mines, where orcs, hobgoblins, and ogres toil under the lash—creatures the Chaos Dwarves despise with utter contempt.\n\nFor centuries, they have bided their time, perfecting their war machines and bolstering their armies of twisted creations. Now, the time draws near for them to strike out and claim the Dark Lands entirely. With their infernal weaponry and unyielding discipline, the Chaos Dwarves are ready to impose their iron rule on the lands around them, crushing any who dare oppose their dominion. Their neighbors, chaotic and disorganized, will be swept aside as the empire of Hashut rises."

string_start_title_imperial:0 "The Men of the Old World"
string_start_imperial:0 "The Old World is a testament to humanity’s resilience, its kingdoms each forged through struggle and ambition. At its heart lies the Empire of Sigmar, a realm of independent electorates united under the Emperor, balancing power between its Elector Counts, the Imperial Crown, and the Church of Sigmar. To the north, Kislev’s Tsars and Ice Witches defend against Chaos with discipline and sorcery, while to the west, Bretonnia’s knights uphold ideals of honor and faith in service to the Lady of the Lake.\n\nFurther south, the city-states of Tilea and Estalia embody ambition and adaptability. Tilean condottieri fight for profit, while Estalian explorers seek wealth in distant lands. In the Border Princes, exiles and adventurers carve out precarious domains amidst constant turmoil, representing humanity’s unyielding drive for survival.\n\nYet, these realms face a shared threat - the unrelenting tide of Chaos. Only through unity and sacrifice can they hope to stand as the bulwark against the storm."  


string_start_title_albionise:0 "The Mist-Shrouded Isle of Albion"
string_start_albionise:0 "Albion, shrouded in mist and mystery, is a land of ancient magic and fierce rivalries. Its humans, guided by the Truthsayers, strive to protect their sacred lands from corruption, while sharing the island with the brutish Fimir, dark magic-wielding creatures who prey upon the weak. From the north, Norscan raiders strike Albion’s shores, bringing Chaos and threatening the fragile balance. Survival on the island demands strength, cunning, and unity.\n\nAlbion’s verdant moors and ancient stone circles hum with untapped power, coveted by all who tread its mist-laden soil. The Truthsayers preserve this energy, while Dark Emissaries twist Albion’s clans to serve the Ruinous Powers. Humans face Fimir raids, Norscan invasions, and their own fractured loyalties as they battle for control of Albion’s magic.\n\nThe struggle for Albion could shape the eternal war between Chaos and Order. If the Fimir or Chaos take control, Albion’s power could bring devastation far beyond its shores. Divided and embattled, the island teeters on the edge of ruin, its future precariously balanced."

string_start_vampire_count:0 "Hidden in the shadows of the world, the vampire nations weave a web of intrigue and undeath. From Sylvania to the cursed courts of Mousillon, these immortal rulers prey on the living while plotting to expand their dark dominion. Vampires are not just conquerors but corrupters, capable of turning entire nations to their cause through diplomacy, espionage, and dark magic. A whispered promise of immortality or a well-placed agent can unravel even the strongest kingdoms, spreading vampiric influence like a plague.\n\nRuled by terrifying undead lords like the von Carsteins and Lahmians, these realms summon skeletons, ghouls, and wights to enforce their will. Subtlety is their weapon of choice, as they infiltrate courts, turn noble houses into undead vassals, and sabotage rivals. This allows them to grow their influence without provoking outright war with the Old World’s defenders.\n\nThe threat of vampirism is more than political—it is an existential danger to the world. As the curse spreads, entire populations fall to undeath, their lands turned into lifeless domains of eternal night. For those who stand against the vampires, failure means not only death but eternal servitude in the armies of darkness. The nations of the world must guard both their borders and their souls to resist this rising horror.\n\n§RVampires may spread their curse peacefully through the Convert Them diplomatic action or the Implant Cults spy action."

string_start_norscan:0 "The fierce tribes of Norsca hail from the frozen northern wastes, where survival is a brutal struggle against harsh elements and monstrous beasts. Devoted to the Ruinous Powers, the Norscans worship the gods of Chaos, offering blood and plunder in exchange for unholy blessings. Their warriors raid the Old World in savage attacks, looting and burning to prove their worth to the dark gods.\n\nChaos defines Norscan life, from their champions, twisted by mutations and arcane power, to their marauding warbands and monstrous allies. As they destroy and conquer, the Norscans spread Chaos’s will, sowing instability in the Old World. Their leaders compete for the gods' favor, knowing only the strongest and most brutal may rise to glory.\n\nIn the Age of the End Times, Norscans and other Chaos nations vie to crown the Everchosen, champion of the Ruinous Powers. The most powerful Chaos nation holds the best chance of ascension, its leader gaining immense strength and uniting Chaos under their rule. Every Norscan victory edges the world closer to ruin, heralding the apocalyptic storm to come.\n\n§RThe Everchosen will be selected from a Chaos nation in the age of the End Times.

From the desolate Chaos Wastes, they spread destruction and corruption across the Old World, fighting for the favor of their gods. Each warrior seeks blessings, mutations, and ultimate ascension, their warbands uniting ruthless champions, marauding tribes, and monstrous creatures in a relentless crusade.\n\nChaos-aligned nations rise by serving the Ruinous Powers, gaining favor through growth and destruction. Completing the Chaos Warrior mission tree grants powerful boons and greatly increases the chance to become the Everchosen. Larger and more developed Chaos nations have the best chance to claim this title, their strength and conquests drawing the gods’ gaze and fulfilling their apocalyptic ambitions.\n\nIn the Age of the End Times, the Everchosen will emerge as the champion of Chaos, wielding immense power to unite the Ruinous Powers’ forces under one banner. This figure will lead a tide of destruction that threatens to engulf the world in darkness. Every conquest brings the Chaos nations closer to this ultimate goal, as the Warriors of Chaos march to unleash the final storm.\n\n§RThe Everchosen will be selected from a Chaos nation in the age of the End Times.

These servants of Chaos revel in their dark pacts with the Ruinous Powers, trading loyalty and blood sacrifice for power and protection. Fimir society is ruled by sinister matriarchs and warlike nobles, their legions of mist-wreathed warriors and enslaved thralls spreading fear and destruction. Isolated yet deeply connected to Chaos, the Fimir seek not only dominance over Albion but a place of prominence in the dark gods’ eternal plans.\n\nIn the Age of the End Times, the Fimir, like all Chaos-aligned nations, vie for the favor of the Ruinous Powers, striving to elevate one of their own as the Everchosen. Through conquest, sacrifice, and completing their own sinister missions, a Fimir nation can rise to claim this apocalyptic mantle. Larger and more powerful Fimir realms, marked by their devotion and destruction, hold the greatest chance of gaining the gods' blessings. This ultimate prize would unify their fractured clans under a single banner, unleashing their cyclopean might upon the world.\n\nShould a Fimir leader ascend as the Everchosen, Albion’s already fragile balance would collapse entirely, and their corrupted magic would spill into the wider Old World. With the dark gods’ power behind them, the Fimir would march as the vanguard of Chaos, spreading ruin far beyond their misty homeland. As Albion teeters on the brink of disaster, the Fimir sharpen their blades and prepare their dark rites, knowing their time may soon come to claim ultimate power."

string_start_wood_elf:0 "The Wood Elves are an ancient and reclusive people, dwelling in the enchanted forests of the Old World, far from the turmoil of human and dwarven lands. Their society thrives in harmony with nature, guided by mystical leaders and protected by skilled warriors and powerful forest spirits. Fiercely isolationist, the Wood Elves guard their woodland realms with unwavering vigilance, striking out at intruders with deadly precision. To them, the world beyond the forest is a place of corruption and chaos, and they see themselves as its last true defenders.\n\nThe strength of the Wood Elves is inextricably tied to their forests, where ancient magic flows and nature’s power is at its peak. Within these magical groves, their armies are nearly invincible, bolstered by the spirits of the forest and the blessings of the Asrai gods. However, the elves struggle to adapt to lands without forests or jungles, finding little benefit from controlling barren or urbanized provinces. For the Asrai, each forest is not only a home but a source of sustenance and spiritual strength, making its preservation essential to their survival.\n\nThough the Wood Elves shun the wider world, their power and influence are undeniable. They see themselves as protectors of balance, ensuring the sanctity of nature in the face of growing Chaos. Yet their refusal to engage in broader alliances leaves them vulnerable to the rising storm, their strength confined to the woods they call home. As the Age of the End Times looms, the Wood Elves must decide whether to step from the shadows or risk losing their forests—and their way of life—forever.\n\n§RAs a Wood Elf, you have a tough time administering lands outside of Forest."

As the self-proclaimed protectors of the world, they see it as their duty to maintain balance and ward off the forces of Chaos. Their mastery of magic and naval power is unmatched, allowing them to influence events far beyond their shores. However, their arrogance and aloofness often alienate potential allies, leaving them isolated in their struggle to uphold their lofty ideals.\n\nUlthuan’s strength lies in its intricate network of magical waystones, which channel immense arcane energy to stabilize the world and shield it from the Realm of Chaos. High Elf armies are disciplined and versatile, with a unique affinity for magic that enhances their combat prowess. Their colonies across the globe extend their reach, but lands without strategic or magical importance are often neglected, reflecting their focus on preserving their heartlands. For the High Elves, the defense of Ulthuan is paramount, for its fall would spell doom for their race and the wider world.\n\nAs the Age of the End Times approaches, the High Elves face growing threats from all sides—Dark Elf raiders, Chaos invasions, and the unraveling of the world’s delicate balance. Their leaders must weigh whether to retreat to Ulthuan’s defenses or risk their diminishing strength in aiding the mortal races.

string_start_vampire_coast:0 "The Vampire Coast is a nightmarish realm of piracy and undeath, ruled by vampiric admirals who command fleets of ghostly ships and undead sailors. Nestled in the tropical reaches of the world, these vampirates combine their lust for power with an insatiable hunger for plunder, raiding coastal settlements and claiming the seas as their domain. Their cursed fleets are feared for their relentless assaults, and their leaders, from Luthor Harkon to other infamous sea lords, use necromancy to bolster their ranks with the corpses of their enemies. To the Vampire Coast, the oceans are both battlefield and lifeblood, where they can extend their undead empire far beyond landlocked rivals.\n\nThe strength of the Vampire Coast lies in its mastery of naval warfare and its ability to raise undead armies at sea. Their settlements thrive on piracy, thriving most where trade routes converge, while traditional inland provinces hold less appeal. Coastal regions are not merely strategic but essential, providing the resources and bodies needed to fuel their undead legions. With their dark magic, they create monstrous abominations and weaponize the seas themselves, making their fleets unmatched in terror and power.\n\nIn the Age of the End Times, the Vampire Coast’s ambitions grow ever darker. As Chaos rises, the vampirates see an opportunity to expand their dominion, preying on weakened nations and rival fleets. Their leaders, consumed by greed and unholy ambition, seek to seize power not only over the seas but to extend their curse across the world.

Above all, they harbor an intense hatred for the Skaven, whose corruption and machinations are an affront to the sacred order the Lizardmen strive to protect.\n\nLustria’s dense jungles are both a fortress and a weapon for the Lizardmen, as the hostile terrain favors their ambush tactics and natural resilience.
