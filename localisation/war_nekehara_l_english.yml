Guarded by elite warriors and imbued with ancient magic, the tomb is meticulously maintained to reflect Settra’s unyielding dominance.

Though its power has waned since the departure of Nagash, it remains a focal point of necromantic magic, radiating dark energies across the land. Now under the control of the Tomb Kings, the pyramid still holds immense potential for any who dare to wield its sinister power."

Within its labyrinthine passages lie untold riches and the mummified remains of long-dead rulers, each guarded by eternal sentinels. Restoring and maintaining this vast necropolis is key to the continued prestige and power of Nehekhara’s ruling class."

Here, the priests of the Mortuary Cult perform the ancient rituals that sustain the undead legions of the Tomb Kings. Although still influential, the temple’s power has diminished, and efforts to restore it are crucial to maintaining the spiritual and magical strength of Nehekhara."

Erosion and neglect have left the monument in a state of disrepair, though it still stands as a symbol of eternal guardianship over the desert. Efforts to restore the sphinx would be seen as a gesture of strength and reverence for Nehekhara’s proud past."

Once a vital location for worship and rest, the oasis has fallen into neglect under the rule of the undead. Though diminished, it remains a sacred place, and restoring it could reinvigorate the faith of the Nehekharan people and strengthen their connection to the divine."

Once a powerful symbol of divine favor, the obelisk now stands largely forgotten and eroded by the sands of time. Restoring its glory would reconnect the Tomb Kings with the lost power of their ancient gods, solidifying their claim to rule the desert forever."
