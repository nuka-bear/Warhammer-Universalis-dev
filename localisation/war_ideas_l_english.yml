The Sorcerer must utilise the forbidden dark arts to weaken the thin skein of reality and create a portal through which a daemon may be drawn forth. The Dark Apostle must entreat the Ruinous Powers and bind that denizen to his ferocious will, thus dragging it through the portal the Sorcerer has created. The Warpsmith's role is to provide the mechanical shell into which the daemon is bound, and to set the warding-chains upon it so that the daemon does not escape.\n\nIn some cases, those who seek to create the Daemon Engine are dragged through the portal they have created and cast adrift upon the tides of the Warp, their bodies torn apart in seconds by the predators of that unreal dimension, their souls fed upon for all eternity.

The logs are then bought by brokers, loaded on barges, and shipped out. "
 A03_idea_6:0 "T  he Kind Men of Hochland"
 A03_idea_6_desc:0 "Hochlanders are pretty friendly, as their province is heavily traveled by people crossing or visiting so are a pretty nice bunch of people to be around, though other provinces have suggested that this if from open-eyed naivete because Sigmar forbid someone in the Empire is just nice to other people."

 A07_idea_5:0 "Eaters of Anything"
 A07_idea_5_desc:0 "Notoriously thrifty, Ostlanders are known for their ability to survive. Said to be capable of eating anything, there are several mocking songs about the famous ‘Stone soup of Ostland’ They are so creative in their frugality that a common joke in the Empire claims that Ostlanders make ‘stone soup’ with only one stone, for fear of wasting good rocks."
 A07_idea_6:0 "A Bastion of Sigmar"
 A07_idea_6_desc:0 "Ostlanders, like most Imperials, honour all the gods and celebrate their feast days. If one god is favoured over another, however, it is Sigmar, who is worshipped with a degree of devotion not often seen in the east of the Empire. Surrounded by lands that lean toward Ulric and Taal and Rhya, few know why this is so, though many offer explanations. Devout Ostlanders say it stems from the time when, soon after the founding of the Empire, a great dragon ravaged Ostland. The other electors and their armies were afraid to face the beast, so Sigmar came alone and killed it after a great fight alongside the Ostland Count. On the other hand, cynics suggest that Ostlanders are so devoted because their “poor cousin” Electors have to keep borrowing money from wealthy Reiklanders and thus need to keep them happy. Whatever the truth, it is a fact that even the smallest Ostlander village sports multiple shrines to Sigmar"

The Stir is both a well-travelled trade route and the entire northern border of Stirland.

These women were the first of many new bloodlines to come into the region, now named Ostermark.\n\nTo this mixture were added Ungol elements during the invasions of the mid-18th century IC, bringing a horse-raising culture to Ostermark's Veldt region. Kislevites would cross the border, too, though more as settlers than conquerors, fleeing the cruelties of their tsar or natural disasters such as famine or drought.

In response, Grand Master Kessler and his warriors rode back to their chapter house leaving Hertwig's army to fight the invading Orcs without their aid. \n\nThough the greenskins were eventually defeated, the count's army suffered horrific losses and for many years, the Ostermark was dependant on aid from the armies of Ostland or Talabecland for its survival. Needless to say, Hertwig's Folly (as it has now become known) stands as a cautionary tale to those who would allow ego to blind them to the value of having the greatest warriors of the Empire fighting alongside them."

A Tilean condottiero like many others, Colombo is also an accomplished marksman, navigator, explorer, adventurer, commander, merchant, diplomat and the most fashionable in Lustria; at least, according to his biographers. Be as it may, his skills led him to become a famed general, the Prince of Trantio in Tilea, and one of the few beings in existence with a usable line of contacts with the Slanns of Lustria, or at least their Skink chiefs, a line that goes all the way up to Lord Mazdamundi himself nevertheless.\n\nNot unlike when treating with Dwarfs, a single faux pas can lead to not only economic collapse of a valuable trade line, but also utter destruction. Colombo is well-aware of the fact, and handles his contacts personally and carefully. In exchange for exorbitantly valuable items, Colombo leads his forces against any such marauding foe that the lethargic Lizardmen don't have the initiative to handle directly, such as Dark Elves or other pirates. With that in mind, Colombo also has little patience for other humans who constantly put his privileged trade partnership at risk with their callous greed, as opposed to his own well-managed fine taste."

Arriving in Remas he spent all his wealth hiring a great army of mercenaries, including a strong contingent from Remas. Returning without delay, and reinforced by a contingent of Sea Elves, the force succeeded in entering the harbour unnoticed and sneaking into the city, catching the Skaven unawares and driving them back, driving them back into the catacombs. There followed further bitter fighting within the rock of the acropolis before all the Skaven were finally cleared.\n\nFighting between the Tobarans and the Ratmen continued on and off for many years with countless skirmishes in the lower levels. An end was finally achieved with the collapse of several strategic tunnels by Dwarf Engineers, allowing the city guard to better watch the entrances to the city. A permanent garrison of warriors, the Deepwatch, are employed to regularly patrol the tunnels and to root out any sign of Skaven.

The Deepwatch are in essence a guild of professional adventurers, with groups dispatched into the tunnels beneath the city to keep them clear from monsters and stop any creatures from reaching the city.

As per tradition in Nuln, wealthy families send their eldest sons to the Officer Academy of the great Gunnery School. Bernhardt spent four years learning and gained a reputation as a gifted but troublesome student, graduating at the top of every class he bothered to attend. He was attracted to the glamour of the Cavalry and was known to outride the Reikguard Knights who visited at times. However, he was eventually expelled from the academy for gross insubordination, duelling, and misappropriation of college funds. Bernhardt attempted to join the Knightly orders, but all refused him due to his checkered history. He was even denied a place in the Empire Pistoliers. Despite this setback, Bernhardt now leads the famed mercenary army, the Grudgebringers, named after the magical sword wielded by Bernhardt himself. This mighty blade was forged by the Dwarfs and inscribed with magic runes by a Bright Wizard. The sword was gifted to a young Bernhardt in a supposed chance meeting at the alehouse, the Kippered Herring. An ageing Arch Wizard, Darius Redhand III of the Bright College in Altdorf, saw potential in this upstart and knowing his sword's unquenchable thirst for battle bequeathed it to Morgan."

Now Bernhardt’s mercenary army must halt the unstoppable tide of evil that assaults the Empire before all is lost.

As such, Dwarf Engineers and Powder Masters have developed a number of substances that, although harmless if ingested by Dawi, are fast-acting and very effective when introduced to Skaven bloodstreams.

The weapons of war and magics of the Skytitans slew most of the Ogre race in what came to be known as the War in the Sky, but in the end the dwindled Ogres still outnumbered the Skytitans hundreds to one and the isolated, singular lifestyle of the Skytitans prevented them from uniting, resulting in each Skytitan being besieged and eaten (often alive) in his own home by packs of vermin-like Ogres."

I have accomplished feats with cannons, steam, and magic that they can only dream of. My people are prepared for the coming times, aligned with those who will be the final victors. We will have slaves in abundance for our aid to the forces of Chaos and that is well for it is blood that greases the cogs of Hashut’s sacred machines.'\n--Vikram Flametongue, Chaos Dwarf Sorcerer"

His temple is guarded by Bull Centaurs, creatures mutated from Chaos Dwarfs long ago. They have the body of a bull but the torso of a Chaos Dwarf, with long snaggly tusks and exotically curled beards.\n\nInside the temple its guardians perform bloodthirsty rites, throwing captives into cauldrons of molten metal to the echoing laughter of the assembled Daemonsmiths, who also serve as the ruling priesthood of Hashut. On top of the temple stands the iron statue of Hashut. Its hollow iron belly contains a furnace heated by coals so that the statue glows red hot and anyone who touches its surface suffers searing wounds.\n\nThe god is the embodiment of the city, its deity and its master, whose power flows through the Chaos Dwarf Sorcerers, and for whom thousands of slaves are sacrificed by fire and furnace."

Down the years they have been sculpted by their owners until they resemble great ships. They are regarded by the Elves as being the furthest outposts of Naggaroth and they range the seas performing inscrutable errands in the service of their blood God.\n\nn battle, Arks are terrible. As they sail inexorably closer to their foes the water around them seethe with a horde of monsters which swarm around the enemy ships."

 druchii_group_idea_6_desc:0 "The ancestors of the Shades once ruled Clar Karond but were betrayed and exiled by their peers. Now the outcast clans have become utterly at home in the wilderness of the Blackspine Mountains, moving as silently as ghosts through petrified forests and razor-sharp rocks. Their lives are vicious, even by the harsh standards of Dark Elves. Every day is a battle for survival with the dread beasts of the mountains; every night a gauntlet of drum-driven king-sacrifice and death duelling. The Shades' hardiness makes them valued additions to any raiding fleet, and many Dreadlords expend much wealth in enticing them to their cause. When the army attacks, the Shades infiltrate the enemy battleline. From this position, they can harass the foe with volleys of dark-fletched bolts, or strike out and slay war machine crews with glinting blades."

 asur_group_idea_4:0 "Citizen-Militia"
 asur_group_idea_4_desc:0 "The militia forces of the Asur are nothing like the humans, as Asur militias are expertly trained, armed and armoured. A High Elf usually spends twenty to thirty years as part of an Archer regiment. During this time they are educated in the rudiments of warfare and armed with a sword and longbow. They will then train with a sword and longbow until his or her expertise far exceeds the ability of an average human soldier. Only after these weapons are mastered is the High Elf allowed to witness battle, as an Archer. In disciplined ranks the High Elf Archers of Ulthuan fire precise volleys of deadly arrows upon their foes, bringing many of them down before they even get a chance to swing their weapon."

 asur_group_idea_5_desc:0 "The High Elf Navy is the finest fleet in the Known World. The High Elves are a seafaring race, and their navy is the most powerful in the world. Even the Dark Elves are unable to match the expertise of the High Elf fleets. The individual ships that make up the fleets are superb examples of elven craftsmanship. Each ship is made by artisan shipwrights that have studied their art not for decades, but for centuries."

In accordance with Bel-Hathor's wishes, the ruling council elected Finubar. Thus, Finubar is the first Phoenix King to be chosen by his predecessor."

 woodelf_idea_6:0 "Wineries"
 woodelf_idea_6_desc:0 "As the Wood Elves are a race for whom feasting takes on an almost spiritual quality, it shouldn't be a great surprise to learn that, deep within Athel Loren's forest glades, land is set aside especially for the cultivation of fine grapes for winemaking. And not just any wine either - the wondrous nectar the Asrai produce is among the finest, if not the finest, anywhere in the Old World. Not that many outsiders have had the privilege, of course; as you might expect, as in other matters the Elves are snobbish and aloof, dismissing the attempts of other races as pathetic, borderline-undrinkable imitations of the real thing and rarely allow anyone from beyond the glades to try it."
 woodelf_idea_7:0 "Coined-Based Trade"
 woodelf_idea_7_desc:0 "Most of the Asrai do not utilise any traditional form of currency, as is the custom throughout the Old World. Money is regarded by the Wood Elves as one of the misguided old inventions of Ulthuan. However, some Hinterglades situated in close proximity to human settlements do adopt metal currency after guides or trackers who work for humans have introduced it. dolescents from suburban Hinterglades are even capable of engaging in human commerce by mimicking human behaviour and values. Wood Elves who choose to live amongst humans often copy their styles of dress."

From the Slann-Emperor court to our own retainers it is through the castles that we make sure that they are constantly reminded of our presence and power.
