In the year 2502 IC, the Cult of Myrmidia is experiencing a schism between the Tilean and Estallian branchs of the Cult. They each have very different perspectives on several major views about the goddess and her lore, not helped by the fact that her three holy books each present very all different accounts of her origins and place varying emphasis on the importance of her story. \n\nMyrmidia is reported by some sacred texts to once have walked the earth clad in mortal flesh. Myrmidia would allegedly grow into a warrior maiden and rally the people of the southern Old World against all enemies. Tileans claim she was born in Remas and conquered Estalia, while the Estalians claim she was born in Magritta and conquered Tilea. Regardless of which version is true, she united the southern civilisations. The day she was crowned queen of the southern realms, however, she was assassinated. When Myrmidia lay dying from her wounds, she ordered a great ship be built, and, it is said, sailed west upon it, there to return to her home amongst the gods, known now, and forever after, as a goddess of war."

 ursun:0 "Great Orthodoxy"
 ursun_religion_desc:0 "The Great Orthodoxy is the organised state religion of Kislev, founded by Tzar Boris Bokha around 2480 IC.  Tzar Boris was concerned that the nature of religion in Kislev -- often taking the form of informal, widely divergent shamanistic rites overseen by wise women, witches and hags in rural areas -- put it at risk of being easily infiltrated and subsumed by the Dark Gods, thus allowing Chaos Cults to flourish. The Great Orthodoxy was thus formed as an attempt to organise, formalise, centralise and regulate traditional religion in Kislev, keeping the various religious cultsunder the strict and watchful eye of the centralised -- and government controlled -- Great Orthodoxy."

According to Dwarflore, the three were born from deep within the hearts of the first mountains of the mortal world, and the entire Dwarf race are descended from them."
