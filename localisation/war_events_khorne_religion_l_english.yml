This meaning, this purpose to which we gather the skulls of our foes?\nIt is nothing. There is no meaning, no purpose. We murder. We kill. It is mindless savagery, this UNIVERSE IS MINDLESS!\nIn mere hours, billions will die. Innocent! Guilty! Strong and weak! Honest and deceitful! ALL of them!\nThey will scream, they will burn, and for no purpose but that mighty Khorne may revel in their bloodshed!\nAnd united in this void of purpose, fear, or duty... we shall at long last be free!\nBlood for the Blood God! Skulls for the Skull Throne! LET! THE GALAXY! BURN!"
