 beastmen.0100.d: "News spreads like wildfire through the towns and villages of the Old World, carried by frightened refugees and frantic messengers. Whispers in hushed tones echo through crowded marketplaces, and fear hangs heavy in the air. The ominous word is out: a Beastmen warband is on the move."
 beastmen.0100.a: "We must perpare for the worst. ."
  
 beastmen.0101.t: "Beastmen Warband Strikes!"
 beastmen.0101.d: "As The Beastmen emerge from their woodland lairs, ten thousand hooves stamp in agitated union, and a foetid musk arises from the sea of matted fur. The bray of the battle-horns pierces the gloom, and beyond."

 disaster_beastmen_horde.5.d: "Within the depths of the forest, the Beastmen conduct dark rituals, invoking foul powers and summoning daemonic entities to aid them in their quest for dominance. The air grows thick with the stench of blood and brimstone as their depraved ceremonies reach a crescendo. The waystone, a sacred artifact imbued with the essence of the Old World, has long served as a bastion of light against the forces of chaos. Yet, malevolent bray Shamans, unseen and insidious, working in unison have twisted its energies, corrupting its sanctity. Now from the shadows of the forest emerge the Beastmen, savage and relentless in their pursuit of pillage and defilement. Emboldened by the corruption of the waystone, they launch raids and ambushes on nearby settlements in numbers not seen since Gorthor the Beastlord. If we do not act soon our fair province may share the same fate as Drakwald or Solland."
