###### RANDOM THOUGHTS ######
#############################

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

	Give Everybody a starting ruler
	DONE: A, B, G, H
2502.1.1 = {
	monarch = {
		name = "AlfrÃ­kr"
		dynasty = "Ragarsson"
		birth_date = 2470.12.3
		adm = 3
		dip = 2
		mil = 4
	}
}

	Switch up multiple different gov types and religions for each area.
	Worry about military balance

Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire

Raiding happens when people reclaim their own lands
	Might be fixed, check if this works. - Nope!

Burger Privelage if your capital is in a subterranean zone, then you get + in subterranean, - in non-subterranean
	Look at hydralaogic empire.
	Use the same mechanic for magical and non-magical forests for wood elves - Bonus for magical foest, penalty for anything not forest or jungle
	This could be + minimum autonomy for non preferred zone
	Vampiric Corruption too
	Dwarves, Skaven, Wood Elves.
	Could be everybody really, or mostly everybody, for favored terrains.

Increase culture conversion cost & times, missionary cost, autonomy from wrong culture & religion?

Add the warhammer legendary lords into the map, with legendary traits

Make the fightiness AI choose nobody if every neighboring is at least 2x stronger than them. Should add a little fightiness.

Reduce Southern Old World Development - nobody cares about them!

Loss of Cultural Monument Triggered modifiers
	Tomb of Settra, Skavenblight, Eatine Place, Karak, Zhar, Imperial City, Empire Capital

Make various diplomatic actions cause a pop-up for the receiver. And offers?
	Offer to become dominion action?

	Fightiness events that give manpower don't give manpower if you're already above max? They give mil power or something else?

	Images for remaining old world monuments

	Pop-ups for when somebody steals your artifact

	Sword of Khaine Disaster
		Decision to start using
		Can't stop using while at war
		Stability cost to stop using
		Disaster if using for too long

	Give all AI personalities

	Have a Vampiric mission create a center of reformation

	Panama Canal

	Fix Monstrous Unit Cost?
	Pop up when you can vassalize dominions (Doesn't work)


##### Nah Stuff ####
Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liverty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

###### END TIMES ######
#############################
End Times

	TLDR, it's a reskin of Revolutions but more powerful and tied to religion.
		1) At the start of the End Times Age, a Ruinous Power (4 Chaos Gods, Hashut, Norsca) is chosen to the be Everchosen/Revolutionary Target. This is almost always the biggest chaos nation, meaning it will probably be either the Choas Dwarves or Norsca. We could force this to be one of the small chaos waste tribes instead if we wanted. The Center of Revolution spawns in their area, and they get the "Everchosen" Government Type.
		2) The Everchosen Government type provides huge bonuses to military and conquest that diminish over 100 years (colonists, manpower, admin eff, power cost reduction). Possibly this is based on the 5th monarchists, and they can explode if criteria are not met.
		3) The Everchosen spreads the revolution through conquest and the Center of Revolution.
		4) Countries get disaster ticks if they are a ruinous powe religion, or if they have a revolution in their provinces. If the disaster fires, it's similar to the revolution disaster: rebels and possibility to switch to the "End Times Bringer" government type. If you are adjacent to the Everchosen, you can also choose to avoid the disaster and just become a Chaos Nation and become a dominion of the Everchosen and take their religion. All provinces with revolution flip as well?
		5) Another revolutionary nation could technically claim the title of Everchosen and take the Revolutionary Target. The only way this is likely to happen is if a major power flips.
		6) Non end-times nations can embrace the counter "revolution" in the normal way.
		7) Non-"revolutionary" nations get the "crush the revolution" cb. The "Dismantle the revolution" peace term removes all the revolution/choas corruption. On success, end times over!

		Devastation just for being near him?

		Make them an end game tag? Make them form a new nation, black?

		Need a CB/Peace offering to get rid of him

		Make the Chaos gate range really high, but a really high factor for same continent

		Multiple gate creation not working
				Decision to destroy a Chaos Gate if you control an area?

		Prevent everchosen from converting?

		Backup to end the endtimes if the everchosen is gone




Vampiric End Times
	Need to figure out Nagash - Maybe 4 additional missions for all vampiric nations to ressurect Nagash?

Orc End Times?

Old Ones End Times?

############## Notes to remember ##############
#################################################

Rename Estates by using war_estates_l_english and common > estates > burgers, church, nobles. Look for "estate_haggle_masters"

	Replace Prestige gain with: add_prestige_or_monarch_power = { amount = 10 }
	Replace Stability gain with: add_stability_or_adm_power = yes
