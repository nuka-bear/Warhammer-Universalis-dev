	Advisors
	Religious Advisor Icons
		Do while watching something?
	Event Pictures: https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/List_of_event_pictures

	Make racial rewards a little less?

	Fix HRE gfx (hre.gui)

	Make Everchosen A Theocracy to make it stickier?

	Old World Pantheons and Enlightened Path are missing GFX
		Should Old World Pantheons be something different from the Kisleve old world religions, or druidism?

	New World Bookmark Mission Image -  Not working!

#############################
###### Confirm ######
#############################

	Goblin 8 Peaks Adj

	Make all Missions Harder?
		Make all "At war with" missions to "won war against" missions
			(araby for example)
			at_war_with_religious_enemy	= yes

			any_country = {
				NOT = { religion = ROOT }
				ROOT = {
					has_won_war_against = {
						who = PREV
						max_years_since = 10
					}
				}
			}

	End the end times peace offering should only come up when applicable

	Need a backup end times events that will trigger if the chaos gate is gone.

	end_times_events.2000 should trigger for everybody to let them know the end times have ended, with unique effects
		test the end of the end times on all receipient sides

	End times stuff based on Chaos Gate

	Empire alliance reward now properly gives trust and favors?

	Fix Monstrous Unit Cost?

#############################
######## FUTURE STUFF #######
#############################

	Many more cultures!

	Age Bonuses
		Be a Ruinous power with over 200 development
		or
		Be at war with a Ruinous power

	Event for a high elf country to go dark elf

	End Times Drama
		Being next to the everchosen (or any chaos dude) makes rebels spawn in that province?

	Recently Raided is weird. Maybe you can't undo the decision while at war, buut your warscore is 2x the cost?
	But then you can't selectively raid?
	Should it go away at the end of the war? Clear all recently raided?

	Raiding happens when people reclaim their own lands
	Might be fixed, check if this works. - Nope!

	Worry about military balance

	Make various diplomatic actions cause a pop-up for the receiver. And offers?
	Offer to become dominion action?
	Pop up when you can vassalize dominions (Doesn't work)
	Convert Them

	Is it possible to be both a race and undead? Undead human, undead orc? And gain both the racial and undead adm/military qualities

	Panama Canal

	Some relationship between racial administration and culture of individual province?

	Adjust Age Bonuses and Localization for Age bonuses

	Should all Old World Human cultures be in the same culture group?

	Add the warhammer legendary lords into the map, with legendary traits

	Make end times start a country event, not a province event

	Use on-actions to Tie administration & mil to primary culture

	Intolerant, with decision to get rid of it

	Make all the tech ground and administration & military stuff come from primary culture?

	Norsca Nation can choose to civilize

	Send raiding party ability to lose manpower, damage relationship, and spawn a rebel army in an adjacent country

	At start of end times all good nations like each other more

	Fightiness events that give manpower don't give manpower if you're already above max? They give mil power or something else?

	Have a Vampiric mission create a center of reformation

	Ruinous power getting great vortex should trigger an event that makes a center of reformation on the location.

	Add some islands? Increase colonial range?

	Finish Starting localization

	Orc End Times?

	Old Ones End Times?
				

#############################
######### NAH STUFF #########
#############################

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liberty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

	Change generic mission tree that gives claim rewards to be just provinces in culture group

	Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire
	Undead in particular is weird

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

Rename Estates by using war_estates_l_english and common > estates > burgers, church, nobles. Look for "estate_haggle_masters"

	Replace Prestige gain with: add_prestige_or_monarch_power = { amount = 10 }
	Replace Stability gain with: add_stability_or_adm_power = yes
