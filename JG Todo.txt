JG To Do & Thoughts

Prevent defender from taking land in racial raiding.

Make the smash and grab decision automatic if in a raiding war? Or alwasy automatic?
	Give a little AE for doing this
	For bigger cities, can take more? Maybe like an additional dev for each 10

get rid of the "You're old" events

Focus on Nehekara to start
	Custom Estates - Mortuary Cult
	Upset Estates with a frozen privilage - "Fractured Society" or something like that that gives them -loyalty. And each monument gives an estate + loyalty
	Decision to improve ruler's stats
	Tension between the Nekeharan Pantheon and Nagashi
	Nagashi religion to ressurect Nagash
	Events
	Decisions
	Rename Some States
	Mission for controlling and having forts on the passes? Maybe missions based on areas
	Change rewards for symbols of power & symbols of religion
	Increase missions to 7 long

Orcs
	Need to stay at war at all times
	Gork & Mork Scales
	Missions
		Get gork & mork scales to different places
		3 different wars at the same time
		Controlling dev 30+ places
		Raid the empire
		Mission choice at the end to improve professionalism or army tradition?
		Raid each major capital: Karak, Khemri, Cathay, Empire
		Give orcs Prussian militarization of state?
		A certain number of subterranean provinces
	Adjust starting vision

Cathay
	Very low crownland
	Estate prevents taking land outside tech group?
	Mandate
	Karma system - bigger maluses (diplo rep?) for not being karmically aligned

Change a lot of the "own" requirements to own or subject own

Fix Monstrous Unit Cost

Mission for controlling whole subcontinent?

Switch Orc religion usage? Instead of Waaagh disasters, use a scale.

Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire


Add Lucky Nations


##### Paused for now #####

Give Sylvania "Blood Kiss" to convert other humans to vamprism

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?



##### Done #####
	Waaagh & No Waaagh Disasters for Orks





Tier 1 Groups

The Empire of Man
Faction: Reikland
Why play: The Empire is one of the most recognizable and pivotal factions in the Warhammer world. Players would be drawn to the Reikland, the heart of the Empire, ruled by Emperor Karl Franz. Players could engage in internal politics, defend against Chaos, and pursue Imperial reforms, making it a dynamic experience with military, political, and religious challenges.
Key Mechanics: Elector Counts, religious turmoil (Sigmarite vs. Ulrican), political reforms, and military innovations.

Bretonnia
Faction: Duchy of Couronne
Why play: Bretonnia offers a feudal, chivalric fantasy with a stark contrast to the more centralized and advanced Empire. Playing as the Duchy of Couronne, ruled by King Louen Leoncoeur, players could lead knightly crusades, maintain strict social order, and manage complex vassal relations. They could also engage with the Lady of the Lake as a spiritual guide.
Key Mechanics: Vassal management, chivalric code, peasant revolts, quests for the Grail.

The High Elves (Ulthuan)
Faction: Eataine (Kingdom of Lothern)
Why play: The High Elves of Ulthuan offer players a unique naval, magical, and diplomatic powerhouse. Eataine, led by Finubar the Seafarer, provides mastery over trade and maritime influence. Defending Ulthuan from Chaos, Dark Elves, and other threats would appeal to players interested in a delicate balance of expansion and defense.
Key Mechanics: Phoenix King election, magic, naval supremacy, intricate diplomacy, and influence over world trade. 
The Dark Elves (Naggaroth)
Faction: Naggarond
Why play: The Dark Elves of Naggarond, ruled by Malekith, offer a chance to play as a brutal, expansionist faction focused on slavery, raiding, and cruelty. The harsh environments of Naggaroth and the eternal quest to reclaim Ulthuan would make this a faction for players who enjoy aggressive tactics and subjugating enemies.
Key Mechanics: Raiding, slavery economy, Black Arks (floating fortresses), political intrigue (rivalries between noble houses), and expansion.

The Vampire Counts (Sylvania)
Faction: Von Carstein Dynasty
Why play: The Vampire Counts provide a dark, undead-focused playstyle where raising legions of the dead and corrupting lands are central themes. Led by Mannfred von Carstein, the Counts offer players a chance to spread undeath across the Old World, subjugating human factions through fear and necromantic power.
Key Mechanics: Undead armies, necromancy, corruption (spreading vampiric influence), and internal power struggles within the Von Carsteins.

Chaos (Norsca)
Faction: Warriors of Chaos
Why play: The Warriors of Chaos, particularly under Archaon the Everchosen, provide a nomadic, war-driven playstyle focused on spreading chaos and destruction. Conquering the Old World, triggering the End Times, and growing ever stronger through dark pacts would appeal to players who enjoy relentless expansion.
Key Mechanics: Chaos invasions, corruption, religious devotion to the Chaos Gods (Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh), and raiding human, dwarf, and elf lands.
The Dwarfs (Karaz Ankor)
Faction: Karaz-a-Karak
Why play: The Dwarfs of Karaz-a-Karak, led by High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer, offer a slower, defensive playstyle that emphasizes technological superiority, strong fortresses, and unyielding resistance. Dwarfs provide rich mechanics around grudges and ancient alliances, and players would work to reclaim lost holds from Orcs, Skaven, and Chaos.
Key Mechanics: Grudges, technology (runecraft and engineering), defense of holds, and economy based on mining and industry.

Skaven (Under-Empire)
Faction: Clan Skryre
Why play: The Skaven are a unique faction that specializes in subterfuge, massive armies, and bizarre technologies. Clan Skryre would appeal to players who enjoy unpredictability, as the clan focuses on warpstone-based weaponry and machines of war. Spreading the Under-Empire across the world and causing mayhem would be core themes.
Key Mechanics: Warpstone resources, ambush tactics, corruption, massive armies, and risky technology development.

Lizardmen (Lustria)
Faction: Hexoatl
Why play: The Lizardmen of Hexoatl, ruled by the powerful mage-priest Lord Mazdamundi, offer a faction with a focus on defending the natural world and enacting the will of the Old Ones. Players would balance exploration of ancient ruins, magical dominance, and the defense of their jungle homeland from Chaos, Skaven, and others.
Key Mechanics: Magic, beast mastery, geomantic web (ancient energy network), and war against corrupting forces.

Orcs & Goblins (Greenskins)
Faction: Grimgorâ€™s 'Ardboyz
Why play: The Greenskins, under the leadership of Grimgor Ironhide, offer a fast-paced, aggressive playstyle focused on constant warfare and expansion. Players would enjoy leading devastating Waaagh! campaigns across the Old World, conquering and pillaging. Internal strife and a focus on orcish culture would add layers of challenge.
Key Mechanics: Waaagh! system, tribal infighting, hordes of goblins and orcs, and the looting economy.

Tomb Kings (Nehekhara)
Faction: Khemri
Why play: The Tomb Kings represent ancient Nehekhara, with a unique undead flavor, but focusing more on honor, kingdom-building, and the restoration of a fallen empire. Khemri, ruled by Settra the Imperishable, offers a different undead playstyle compared to the Vampire Counts, where territorial control and military might are prioritized over corruption.
Key Mechanics: Constructing colossal monuments, undead legions, limited unit recruitment tied to ancient rituals, and reclamation of lost lands.
