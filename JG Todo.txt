	Vision for some countries is still strange, particularly the border princes (look at Barak Varr). Make sure everybody sees entier region subcontinent they are in, and all adjacent regions

Raiding happens when people reclaim their own lands
	Might be fixed, check if this works. - Nope!

Burger Privelage if your capital is in a subterranean zone, then you get + in subterranean, - in non-subterranean

End Times
	Where to find relevant stuff
		defines.lau
		static modifiers
		common > Disasters > revolution
		Events > center of revolution events
		disasters > Revolution disaster

			1) At the start of the End Times Age, a Ruinous Power (4 Chaos Gods, Hashut, Norsca) is chosen to the be Everchosen/Revolutionary Target. This is almost always the biggest chaos nation, meaning it will probably be either the Choas Dwarves or Norsca. We could force this to be one of the small chaos waste tribes instead if we wanted. The Center of Revolution spawns in their area, and they get the "Everchosen" Government Type.
			2) The Everchosen Government type provides huge bonuses to military and conquest that diminish over 100 years (colonists, manpower, admin eff, power cost reduction). Possibly this is based on the 5th monarchists, and they can explode if criteria are not met.
			3) The Everchosen spreads the revolution through conquest and the Center of Revolution.
			4) Countries get disaster ticks if they are a ruinous powe religion, or if they have a revolution in their provinces. If the disaster fires, it's similar to the revolution disaster: rebels and possibility to switch to the "Chaos Nation" government type. If you are adjacent to the Everchosen, you can also choose to avoid the disaster and just become a Chaos Nation and become a dominion of the Everchosen.



		Need to adjust the revolution disaster
	Disaster in end times age that starts for all relevant factions - ticks up from development, army, maybe some monuments. Has grown by.
		Nah use center of revolution
	The first person who gets it becomes the end times bringer, ending the disaster for everyone (and triggering an event for everyone)
	Endtimes bringer gets

		+500 devastation creation? Devastation just for being near him?
		Some way of forcing him to wage war?
		When he takes a province that has 3 development, or a province is brought to 100% devastation, it becomes decolonized, He will probably immediately colonize it.
		Gains favors and trust with all other of that religion and tech group, eventually bringing them into dominion
		Event to declare war on neighbors if not at war
		Bonuses on 5th monarchist thing, but highest bonuses at the start, gettting weaker.

		Event to make revolutionary places dominions of revolutionary target - Or this is the revolutionary disaster?

		Think about the government reform - can we have people keep their government reforms, but still be seen as revolutionary?

		Non-ruinouspowers should convert to Chaos Undivided

		Revolution Target gets special government type which gives it all the perks slowly decreasing over 50 years. Government mechanic

		Adjust revolutionary disaster to be either you are a ruinous dude, or you have big problems

		Making the dominions messes with the framerate - Don't do this!

		Crush the revolution cb?

Cathay
	Disaster if Cathay provinces not owned by cathay dudes (or maybe just bastion?)

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liverty desire for others.


Bugs
	Fix Monstrous Unit Cost?
	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working
	Pop up when you can vassalize dominions (Doesn't work)

##### Paused for now #####

Give Sylvania "Blood Kiss" to convert other humans to vamprism

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire



Tier 1 Groups

The Empire of Man
Faction: Reikland
Why play: The Empire is one of the most recognizable and pivotal factions in the Warhammer world. Players would be drawn to the Reikland, the heart of the Empire, ruled by Emperor Karl Franz. Players could engage in internal politics, defend against Chaos, and pursue Imperial reforms, making it a dynamic experience with military, political, and religious challenges.
Key Mechanics: Elector Counts, religious turmoil (Sigmarite vs. Ulrican), political reforms, and military innovations.

Bretonnia
Faction: Duchy of Couronne
Why play: Bretonnia offers a feudal, chivalric fantasy with a stark contrast to the more centralized and advanced Empire. Playing as the Duchy of Couronne, ruled by King Louen Leoncoeur, players could lead knightly crusades, maintain strict social order, and manage complex vassal relations. They could also engage with the Lady of the Lake as a spiritual guide.
Key Mechanics: Vassal management, chivalric code, peasant revolts, quests for the Grail.

The High Elves (Ulthuan)
Faction: Eataine (Kingdom of Lothern)
Why play: The High Elves of Ulthuan offer players a unique naval, magical, and diplomatic powerhouse. Eataine, led by Finubar the Seafarer, provides mastery over trade and maritime influence. Defending Ulthuan from Chaos, Dark Elves, and other threats would appeal to players interested in a delicate balance of expansion and defense.
Key Mechanics: Phoenix King election, magic, naval supremacy, intricate diplomacy, and influence over world trade. 
The Dark Elves (Naggaroth)
Faction: Naggarond
Why play: The Dark Elves of Naggarond, ruled by Malekith, offer a chance to play as a brutal, expansionist faction focused on slavery, raiding, and cruelty. The harsh environments of Naggaroth and the eternal quest to reclaim Ulthuan would make this a faction for players who enjoy aggressive tactics and subjugating enemies.
Key Mechanics: Raiding, slavery economy, Black Arks (floating fortresses), political intrigue (rivalries between noble houses), and expansion.

The Vampire Counts (Sylvania)
Faction: Von Carstein Dynasty
Why play: The Vampire Counts provide a dark, undead-focused playstyle where raising legions of the dead and corrupting lands are central themes. Led by Mannfred von Carstein, the Counts offer players a chance to spread undeath across the Old World, subjugating human factions through fear and necromantic power.
Key Mechanics: Undead armies, necromancy, corruption (spreading vampiric influence), and internal power struggles within the Von Carsteins.

Chaos (Norsca)
Faction: Warriors of Chaos
Why play: The Warriors of Chaos, particularly under Archaon the Everchosen, provide a nomadic, war-driven playstyle focused on spreading chaos and destruction. Conquering the Old World, triggering the End Times, and growing ever stronger through dark pacts would appeal to players who enjoy relentless expansion.
Key Mechanics: Chaos invasions, corruption, religious devotion to the Chaos Gods (Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh), and raiding human, dwarf, and elf lands.
The Dwarfs (Karaz Ankor)
Faction: Karaz-a-Karak
Why play: The Dwarfs of Karaz-a-Karak, led by High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer, offer a slower, defensive playstyle that emphasizes technological superiority, strong fortresses, and unyielding resistance. Dwarfs provide rich mechanics around grudges and ancient alliances, and players would work to reclaim lost holds from Orcs, Skaven, and Chaos.
Key Mechanics: Grudges, technology (runecraft and engineering), defense of holds, and economy based on mining and industry.

Skaven (Under-Empire)
Faction: Clan Skryre
Why play: The Skaven are a unique faction that specializes in subterfuge, massive armies, and bizarre technologies. Clan Skryre would appeal to players who enjoy unpredictability, as the clan focuses on warpstone-based weaponry and machines of war. Spreading the Under-Empire across the world and causing mayhem would be core themes.
Key Mechanics: Warpstone resources, ambush tactics, corruption, massive armies, and risky technology development.

Lizardmen (Lustria)
Faction: Hexoatl
Why play: The Lizardmen of Hexoatl, ruled by the powerful mage-priest Lord Mazdamundi, offer a faction with a focus on defending the natural world and enacting the will of the Old Ones. Players would balance exploration of ancient ruins, magical dominance, and the defense of their jungle homeland from Chaos, Skaven, and others.
Key Mechanics: Magic, beast mastery, geomantic web (ancient energy network), and war against corrupting forces.

Orcs & Goblins (Greenskins)
Faction: Grimgor’s 'Ardboyz
Why play: The Greenskins, under the leadership of Grimgor Ironhide, offer a fast-paced, aggressive playstyle focused on constant warfare and expansion. Players would enjoy leading devastating Waaagh! campaigns across the Old World, conquering and pillaging. Internal strife and a focus on orcish culture would add layers of challenge.
Key Mechanics: Waaagh! system, tribal infighting, hordes of goblins and orcs, and the looting economy.

Tomb Kings (Nehekhara)
Faction: Khemri
Why play: The Tomb Kings represent ancient Nehekhara, with a unique undead flavor, but focusing more on honor, kingdom-building, and the restoration of a fallen empire. Khemri, ruled by Settra the Imperishable, offers a different undead playstyle compared to the Vampire Counts, where territorial control and military might are prioritized over corruption.
Key Mechanics: Constructing colossal monuments, undead legions, limited unit recruitment tied to ancient rituals, and reclamation of lost lands.
