###### RANDOM THOUGHTS ######
#############################

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire

	Vision for some countries is still strange, particularly the border princes (look at Barak Varr). Make sure everybody sees entier region subcontinent they are in, and all adjacent regions

Raiding happens when people reclaim their own lands
	Might be fixed, check if this works. - Nope!

Burger Privelage if your capital is in a subterranean zone, then you get + in subterranean, - in non-subterranean
	Look at hydralaogic empire.
	Use the same mechanic for magical and non-magical forests for wood elves - Bonus for magical foest, penalty for anything not forest or jungle
	This could be + minimum autonomy for non preferred zone


Dimmed Sunz starts with no army!

Increase culture conversion cost & times, missionary cost, autonomy from wrong culture & religion?

Add Legendary Warrior/Diplomat/Administrator to ruler traits & give them to the key figures

Add the warhammer legendary lords into the map

Add legendary weapon that are traits that move between people

ADd 1 legendary artifact per culture group (like the phoenix crown)

Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

Make the fightiness AI choose nobody if every neighboring is at least 2x stronger than them. Should add a little fightiness

Reduce Southern Old World Development - nobody cares about them!

Dominion tweaks
	Make event for dominions to declare on their leader
	+5% more liberty desire
	Demoting a dominion lowers all trust by 30

Allow elven religions to convert to each other. Sam with human religions? Most religions?

Add Clan Pestilens to Southlands, and A skaven to old world bookmark

Fix all the "Great power rank" triggers

Loss of Cultural Monument Triggered modifiers
	Tomb of Settra, Skavenblight, Eatine Place, Karak, Zhar, Imperial City


Make various diplomatic actions cause a pop-up for the receiver. And offers?
	Offer to become dominion action?



#############################
###### END TIMES ######
#############################
End Times
	Where to find relevant stuff
		defines.lau
		static modifiers
		common > Disasters > revolution
		Events > center of revolution events
		disasters > Revolution disaster

		TLDR, it's a reskin of Revolutions but more powerful and tied to religion.
			1) At the start of the End Times Age, a Ruinous Power (4 Chaos Gods, Hashut, Norsca) is chosen to the be Everchosen/Revolutionary Target. This is almost always the biggest chaos nation, meaning it will probably be either the Choas Dwarves or Norsca. We could force this to be one of the small chaos waste tribes instead if we wanted. The Center of Revolution spawns in their area, and they get the "Everchosen" Government Type.
			2) The Everchosen Government type provides huge bonuses to military and conquest that diminish over 100 years (colonists, manpower, admin eff, power cost reduction). Possibly this is based on the 5th monarchists, and they can explode if criteria are not met.
			3) The Everchosen spreads the revolution through conquest and the Center of Revolution.
			4) Countries get disaster ticks if they are a ruinous powe religion, or if they have a revolution in their provinces. If the disaster fires, it's similar to the revolution disaster: rebels and possibility to switch to the "End Times Bringer" government type. If you are adjacent to the Everchosen, you can also choose to avoid the disaster and just become a Chaos Nation and become a dominion of the Everchosen and take their religion. All provinces with revolution flip as well?
			5) Another revolutionary nation could technically claim the title of Everchosen and take the Revolutionary Target. The only way this is likely to happen is if a major power flips.
			6) Non end-times nations can embrace the counter "revolution" in the normal way.
			7) Non-"revolutionary" nations get the "crush the revolution" cb. The "Dismantle the revolution" peace term removes all the revolution/choas corruption. On success, end times over!
